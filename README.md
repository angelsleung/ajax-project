## Current Feature List
1. User can set goals for the number of fruits and vegetables they want to consume
2. User can search for a food item
3. User can view the search results
4. User can view the food item's nutrition facts
5. User can add a food item to their daily log
6. User can remove an item from their daily log
7. User can view their daily log and delete items from their log
8. User can view their progress toward their goals

## Planned Additions
* User can add a food item as a favorite, which saves the food categorization of fruit or vegetable
* User can view their daily log from previous days
* User can view their fiber intake from fruits and vegetables

## What I Learned
* Planning and wireframing are important - designating time to the preparation and design saves hours of time during the coding process
* Implement breakpoints in CSS media queries to ensure mobile responsiveness on a wide range of screen sizes
* Be flexible - must structure the app's features around the data available in the API
* Always keep the user and UX as the primary focus when designing the UI
