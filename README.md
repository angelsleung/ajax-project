# fruit-and-veg-goals

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript app that promotes a healthy lifestyle by tracking users' fruit and vegetable intake and assisting users in reaching their daily consumption goals.

[Live Demo](https://angelsleung.github.io/ajax-project/)

## Current Feature List
* User can set goals for the number of fruits and vegetables they want to consume
* User can search for a food item
* User can view the search results
* User can view the food item's nutrition facts and add the item to their daily log
* User can view their daily log
* User can view their progress toward their goals

## Planned Additions
* User can edit their daily log
* User can add a food item as a favorite, which saves the food categorization of fruit or vegetable
* User can view their daily log from previous days
* User can view their fiber intake from fruits and vegetables

## What I Learned
* Planning and wireframing are important - designating time to the preparation and design saves hours of time during the coding process
* Implement breakpoints in CSS media queries to ensure mobile responsiveness on a wide range of screen sizes
* Be flexible - must structure the app's features around the data available in the API
* Always keep the user and UX as the primary focus when designing the UI
